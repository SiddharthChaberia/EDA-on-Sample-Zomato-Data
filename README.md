# About the project
This is a pretty basic yet informative project, built on a sample dataset of Zomato's partnered restaurants. Based on this data, we draw some conclusions.
My reason behind creating this project is to know more about data analysis, and also explore a few python modules namely `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `pyplot`.

# Summary of the `.ipynb` file
In the attached ipynb file, I imported the datasets, renamed the columns, checked for any discrepancy, and generated some visualizations.

# Conclusions
From the different charts, various conclusions have been drawn

### Conclusion 1
<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/SiddharthChaberia/EDA-on-Sample-Zomato-Data/blob/sidd/charts/chart-1.png" width="350" alt="chart1">
  <h4>The majority of people preferred the restaurants with Dining option. Zomato should work on there buffet and cafes to makw it more neutral</h4>
</p>

### Conclusion 2

  <h4>Another observation supporting the previous observation is that the majority votes were recieved by the Dining restaurants (reason is simple - its the most visited) while others are no where near.</h4>
</p>

### Conclusion 3
<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/SiddharthChaberia/EDA-on-Sample-Zomato-Data/blob/sidd/charts/chart-3.png" width="350" alt="chart1">
  <h4>a majority of the customers gave a rating in the range of 3.75 to 4, but not many gave above 4.5 stars. The average ratings recieved by Zomato was just 3.63 out of 5.</h4>
</p>

### Conclusion 4
<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/SiddharthChaberia/EDA-on-Sample-Zomato-Data/blob/sidd/charts/chart-4.png" width="350" alt="chart1">
  <h4>Most people preffered having food at restaurants in the range of 250-350 for 2 and very few have tried the restaurants with charges above 850 for 2</h4>
</p>

### Conclusion 5
<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/SiddharthChaberia/EDA-on-Sample-Zomato-Data/blob/sidd/charts/chart-5.png" width="350" alt="chart1">
  <h4>People who ordered food online gave better ratings than the ones ordering offline. Possible reasons could be the unheigenic ambience of restaurants, or some misbehaviour of the staffs.</h4>
</p>

### Conclusion 6
<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/SiddharthChaberia/EDA-on-Sample-Zomato-Data/blob/sidd/charts/chart-6.png" width="350" alt="chart1">
  <h4>For Buffet, people prefer both online as well as offline food. For Cafes, people have more preference towards online orders. But for Dining, a strong inclination towards offline orders are observed.</h4>
  <h4>The possible reasons behind this could be the ambience and behaviour of staffs at Dining restaurants. The other types of restaurants should also adopt similar strategies to improve there sales with Zomato's customer</h4>
</p>

#Ending
I made up this project to dive into the main python modules of data science, and expecting to learn more about these modules and more modules in my upcoming months.
